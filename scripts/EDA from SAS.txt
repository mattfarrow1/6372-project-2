Summary
-------
- Variables that seem to matter
  - Categorical: Job, Education, Contact, Month, Marital, Day_of_week, Housing
  - Continuous: Duration, Campaign, Emp_var_rate, Euribor3m, Nr_employed, Previous
- Variables that don't seem to matter
  - Categorical: Default, Loan
  - Continuous: Age, Cons_price_idx, Cons_conf_idx
- Variables that are junk/incomplete data that doesn't add explanatory or predictive capabilities
  - Categorical: Poutcome
  - Continuous: Pdays
- Missing values
  - For categorical, replace with the Mode for each one (listed below)
  - For continuous, only Pdays is missing, and we should delete it, but for completeness, replace with median (6)
- VIF: Variable Inflation Factor
  - Emp_var_rate, Euribor3m, Nr_employed, Cons_price_idx, and Cons_conf_idx are all really just measures of time.
  - They coordinate heavily with "what is the month"
  - PCA should reveal that all of these continuous variables can be coordinated together and further, the month tells you the results as a category
  - Alternately, ignore the month and use these variables to predict, but don't use both


Categorical Variables
---------------------
PROC FREQ

  - Mode: university degree 12,168
  - p-value < 0.0001
- Default
  - Should definitely ignore this field
  - Mode: No, 32,588 (only 3 yes' in the whole dataset)
  - p-value < 0.5054
- Housing
  - Above average: Yes 11.6%
  - Below average: No 10.9%
  - Mode: Yes 21,576
  - p-value < 0.02
- Loan
  - Does not seem to be statistically significant
  - Above average: No 11.3%
  - Below average: Yes 10.9%
  - Mode: No 33,950
  - p-value = 0.3479
- Contact
  - Above average: Cellular 15%

  - Mode: Cellular 26,144
  - p-value < 0.0001
- Month
  - Above average: Mar 51%, Dec 49%, Sep 45%, Oct 44%, Apr 20% [So basically, Sep-Mar except Nov is odd]
  - Below average: May 6%, Jul 9%, Nov 10%, Jun 10.5%, Aug 10.6%
  - Not in dataset: Jan, Feb

  - Not in dataset: Sat, Sun
  - Mode: Thu 8,623
  - No Missing Data
  - p-value < 0.0001
- Poutcome
  - Somewhat misleading variable (when it's present which isn't very often, Yes is above average in both cases)
  - Above average: Success 65%, Failure 14%
  - Below average: NONE (see note above)
  - Mode: Failure 4,252
  - p-value < 0.0001


Continuous Variables
---------------------
PROC MEANS
- Counts
  - No=36,548, Yes=4,640
  - Only continuous variable with missing values is PDAYS
- Total responses: 41,188
- age
  - No: Mean 39.9, Median 38
  - Yes: Mean 40.9, Median 37
- duration
  - No: Mean 221, Median 164, Min 0
  - Yes: Mean 553, Median 449, Min 37
  - Longer the call, the more Yes increases
    - If the call lasts 36 or fewer seconds, it is No 100% of the time
- campaign
  - No: Mean 2.6, Max 56
  - Yes: Mean 2.0, Max 23
  - Median: 2 (for both yes and no)
  - Fewer the campaigns, the more Yes increases
    - If there are more than 23 campaigns, it is No 100% of the time
- pdays
  - Recommend we discard this variable
  - Massive missing continuous variable
    - No real difference between continuous values for yes and no, but:
    - Misleading: when variable exists, Yes is the outcome for Subscribed 64% of the time
  - Median: 6 (for both yes and no)
- previous
  - No: Mean 0.13
  - Yes: Mean 0.49
  - Median: 0 (for both yes and no)
- emp_var_rate
  - No: Mean 0.25, Median 1.1
  - Yes: Mean -1.2, Median -1.8 
  - The lower the emp_var_rate, the more likely to get a Yes. In other words, negatively correlated.
- cons_price_idx
  - Doesn't seem to be very significant
  - No: Mean 94, Median 94
  - Yes: Mean 93, Median 93 
- cons_conf_idx
  - Doesn't seem to be very significant
  - No: Mean -41, Median -42
  - Yes: Mean -40, Median -40 
- euribor3m
  - No: Mean 3.8, Median 4.9
  - Yes: Mean 2.1, Median 1.3 
  - The lower the euribor3m interest rate, the more likely to get a Yes. In other words, negatively correlated.
- nr_employed
  - No: Mean 5176, Median 5196
  - Yes: Mean 5095, Median 5099
  - The lower the nr_employed rate, the more likely to get a Yes. In other words, negatively correlated.
